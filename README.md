# slack-dark-theme for Mac
Instructions and resources for modding Slack 4 with a dark theme. Working as of 8/2019.

# Pre-requisites:
- Slack 4
- node/npm
- npm package asar install globally (npm i -g asar)

# Installation
- Clone or download this repository
- Run hack-slack.sh in a terminal (requires sudo privileges)

# Make CSS Changes (or Create Your Own Theme)
- In downloaded repository, edit slack-dark.css and re-run hack-slack.sh in a terminal and then reload slack

# CSS Current State
The CSS currently checked in is from an older version 3 of Slack, so some functionality is missing dark CSS rules. I'll add these when I have time. Feel free to submit a PR if you have CSS fixes you want to share.
